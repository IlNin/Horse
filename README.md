# Horse
This was the second homework required to pass an exam that dealt with OpenGL and (optionally) other libraries that uses it as their basis.
Even though this one was more complex than the first homework, since it features a hierarchial model (the horse) that animates (jumping over an obstacle), I found it quite easier to make overall since it shares much of the basic theory with the previous work.
I had to write a report for this homework, so for more information you can read that!
